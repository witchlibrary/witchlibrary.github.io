          <p class="booktitle">Title: Italian Folk Magic: Rue's Kitchen Witchery <br> By: Mary-Grace Fahrun </p>

          <p class="bookdesc">Italian Folk Magic is a fascinating journey through the magical, folkloric,
            and healing traditions of Italy with an emphasis on the practical. The reader learns uniquely
            Italian methods of magical protection and divination and spells for love, sex, control, and revenge.
            The book contains magical and religious rituals and prayers and explores divination techniques, crafting,
            blessing rituals, witchcraft, and, of course, the evil eye, known as malocchio in Italian--the author
            explains
            what it is, where it comes from, and, crucially, how to get rid of it. This book can help
            Italians regain their magical heritage, but Italian folk magic is a beautiful, powerful, and effective
            magical tradition that is accessible to anyone who wants to learn it</p>

          <p class="bookdesc">Looking for the meaning behind your Italian grandma's rituals?
            Curious about their source and wondering if there's more to the story?

            the ONLY pervasive holistic system of daily sacred magic indigenous to Italy and her islands, whose

          <p class="bookdesc">Karyn Crisis never had the chance to decide if the spirit world was real or imaginary.
            She has been able to sense the unseen world of passed-on relatives, angels, and ghosts since childhood.
            Training
            as a Spiritualist Medium as an adult, she became a popular platform Medium and healer in the San Francisco
            Bay Area.
            In 2009, she took a fateful trip to Italy’s Tuscany Region, which would have a lasting impact far beyond
            what she could
            have ever imagined: Goddesses from Italy's history suddenly began appearing to Karyn as clearly as other
            spirit people had,
            and they began transmitting to her the information of a most interesting cultural melting pot in Italy that
            gave rise to its
            unique and complex spiritual landscape. Among the information shared
            was the knowledge of Italy's own indigenous Lineage healing: a female shamanism
            hiding in-plain-sight that can be traced back to pre-pagan times.</p>

            dreams, seek protection from evil forces or grumpy neighbours, catch a liar or raise the dead? If so, the
            Sorcerer‘s Screed is just the book for you.

            The spells have been adherent to Scandinavian history and culture for centuries and Icelanders have been
            using magic spells from the first settlement for everyday purposes as well as the more unorthodox.

            The Sorcerer’s Screed is the world‘s most comprehensive collection of Nordic spells. Each spell comes with a
            diagram and specific instructions for their use and purpose.</p>
